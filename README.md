Project Streams

Data / Back-end
1) Ingest and integrate source data from Biomonitor - did this for sub A
2) Explore, analyse and understand the data - try to clean it
3) Train models that can provide contextual input to AI 
  - Classifer 
  - Cluster 
  - Regression tree
 4) Interpretation of results / iterate
 
 
 Front-end 
 1) Design and build an interface & database for the users of biomonitor as dashboard for alerts & notifications
 2) Interface for feedback for reinforcement of training models.
 
 Algorithms: 
 - COnceptualize algorithms using threshold limits, coupled with contextual info 
      - For Cognitive Behaviourial Therapy 
      - Blood Pressure
   
 Hardware: 
 - Design a add-on for the Biomonitor that can be triggered based on data/AI to release medication / take some action
